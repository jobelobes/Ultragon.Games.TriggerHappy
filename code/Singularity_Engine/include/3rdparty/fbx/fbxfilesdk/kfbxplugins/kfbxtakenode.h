/** \brief A take node contains channels of animation.
  * An object derived from class KFbxTakeNodeContainer contains multiple take
  * nodes to hold animation data.
  *
  * In the case of class KFbxNode, a take node contains all animation curves
  * necessary to define the animation for a node and its attribute. By having
  * multiple take nodes, a node might be animated differently. A scene
  * description held in a node hierarchy can be animated differently using
  * different animation take nodes.
  *
  * This object can be used to access the different animation curves
  * that define a take node. Some channels are only accessible once the
  * proper node attribute has been associated with an object of type KFbxNode.
